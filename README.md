# Catastronaut üßëüöÄ
 Simple Python wrapper to retrieve data from the spanish Land Registry ("Catastro") API endpoint.

## ‚ú® Features
- JSON default response can be traversed/modelled using JMESPath syntax. You can choose which data you want to access, how deep, and how to name/label it. More details in the **utils/models.py** file.
- Choose how you want to output the data: raw or in DataFrame (using Polars library)
  - By returning a Polars DataFrame, the user can access its API directly, allowing for further wrangling, transformation or saving the data to disk (JSON, CSV, Parquet, databases, etc.)
- Supports single parameter requests and bulk requests (by passing lists of parameters)
- Verbose error logging and traceback
- Auto-retry and rate limiting
- Caching (TBD)

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
- [JMESPath][jmespath-href] (allows for easy and custom flattening of nested JSON responses)
- [Polars][polars-href] Pandas replacement written in Rust; multithreaded, vectorized and fast like no other.
